# cse539-code
## Code References
Both the Riposte and Sabre code was taken from [https://github.com/avadapal](here). 
There were reimplementations for the Sabre paper. 

- [Riposte](https://github.com/avadapal/Faster-Riposte) (reimplementation)
- [Sabre](https://github.com/avadapal/Sabre)

## TODO
- how to compile inside the containers 
- how to run inside the containers

## Notes
- for Riposte, both the verifier and the simulator work out the box for 2PC
- Sabre, still need to keep modifying for 2PC validator to work.
